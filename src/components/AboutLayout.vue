    h2 My Journey
    p My journey into the world of development began in an unexpected fieldâ€”video game creation. While studying for my Bachelor's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I discovered&nbsp;
        a(href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank") Unity
        |&nbsp;and&nbsp;
        a(href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank") C#
        |. This platform ignited my passion for building engaging digital experiences, a passion that continues to drive my career.
    p Before completing my degree, I gained practical experience in the industrial sector. I started as a 3D model drawer with Autodesk's&nbsp;
        a(href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/" target="_blank") Inventor
        |&nbsp;and&nbsp;
        a(href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/" target="_blank") Autocad&nbsp;
        |&nbsp;at a sheet metal manufacturing company, where I was quickly promoted to Chief Constructor, overseeing HVAC system designs and various industrial projects. My knack for leadership and problem-solving led to another promotion, this time to Chief Engineer of the factory. In this role, I managed large-scale industrial projects, honing my skills in project management and operational logistics.
    p Despite my success in engineering, I felt the pull back to programming. I revisited my roots in&nbsp;
        a(href="https://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank") C++
        |&nbsp;and transitioned to&nbsp;
        a(href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank") Unity
        |&nbsp;and&nbsp;
        a(href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank") C#
        |&nbsp;where I refined my understanding of programming concepts by developing several video games.
    h2 Transition to Web Development
    p Eager to explore new technologies, I delved into web development, quickly mastering&nbsp;
        a(href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank") Vue.js
        |,&nbsp;
        a(href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html" target="_blank") PUG
        |, and&nbsp;
        a(href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank") SCSS
        |. Within four months, I began my career as a Web Developer, where I am currently involved in building and maintaining a comprehensive contract chair selling company website. This role includes developing its CMS and enhancing user-side functionalities, showcasing my ability to handle both the technical and user experience aspects of web development.
    h2 Expanding Horizons
    p Recently, I began expanding my skill set to include&nbsp;
        a(href="https://developer.apple.com/develop/" target="_blank") iOS development
        |, undertaking a course with&nbsp;
        a(href="https://www.tbcacademy.ge/" target="_blank") TBC Academy
        |&nbsp;to deepen my understanding of mobile platforms and participating in hands-on projects that challenge me to apply my skills in new ways.
    h2 Looking Forward
    p As I continue to grow and learn, I am eager to take on new challenges and build solutions that combine aesthetic appeal with functional innovation. I am always on the lookout for opportunities to bring my unique perspective to projects that inspire and innovate.
